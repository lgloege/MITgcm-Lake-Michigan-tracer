# This is a growing list of which comments lines to remove from a file 
# in order to reduce the file size of ad_input_code.f. The first one is 
# for empty lines. 
# We want to remove all comments (=lines starting with C,c,*), but
# compiler directives also start with a C, in particular CADJ/cadj/Cadj/cADJ, 
# and absolutely must remain in the file.
