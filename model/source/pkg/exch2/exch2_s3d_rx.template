C     !DESCRIPTION:
C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH2_S3D_RX
C     | o Handle Simple exchanges (= that ignore corners)
C     |   for _RX, 3-dim scalar arrays with overlap size = 1
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Invoke appropriate exchange routine depending on type
C     | of grid (cube or globally indexed) to be operated on.
C     *==========================================================*

C     !INPUT/OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
C     === Routine arguments ===
C     phi    :: Array with overlap regions are to be exchanged
C     myThid :: My thread id.
      _RX phi(0:sNx+1,0:sNy+1,Nr,nSx,nSy)
      INTEGER myThid

C     !LOCAL VARIABLES:
C     == Local variables ==
C     OL[wens]       :: Overlap extents in west, east, north, south.
C     exchWidth[XY]  :: Extent of regions that will be exchanged.
      INTEGER OLw, OLe, OLn, OLs, exchWidthX, exchWidthY, myNz

CEOP

      OLw        = 1

C     ** NOTE ** The exchange routine we use here does not
C                require the preceeding and following barriers.
C                However, the slow, simple exchange interface
C                that is calling it here is meant to ensure
C                that threads are synchronised before exchanges
C                begine.
