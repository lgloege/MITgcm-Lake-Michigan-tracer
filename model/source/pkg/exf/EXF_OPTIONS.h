c   pkg/exf CPP options:
c   --------------------
c
c   >>> INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FORCING_PACKAGE <<<
c       Include this package into the setup.
c
c   >>> EXF_VERBOSE <<<
c       Do a bit more printout for the log file than usual.
c
c   >>> ALLOW_ATM_WIND <<<
c       If defined, 10-m wind fields can be read-in from files.
c                                        
c   >>> ALLOW_ATM_TEMP <<<
c       If defined, atmospheric temperature and specific
c       humidity fields can be read-in from files.
c                                        
c   >>> ALLOW_DOWNWARD_RADIATION <<<
c       If defined, downward long-wave and short-wave radiation
c       can be read-in form files or computed from lwflux and swflux.
c
c   >>> ALLOW_BULKFORMULAE <<<
c       Allows the use of bulk formulae in order to estimate
c       turbulent and radiative fluxes at the ocean's surface.
c
c   >>> EXF_READ_EVAP <<<
c       If defined, evaporation fields are read-in, rather than
c       computed from atmospheric state.
c                                        
c   >>> ALLOW_RUNOFF <<<
c       If defined, river and glacier runoff can be read-in from files.
c
c   >>> ATMOSPHERIC_LOADING <<<
c       If defined, atmospheric pressure can be read-in from files.
c
c   >>> ALLOW_CLIMSST_RELAXATION <<<
c       Allow the relaxation to a monthly climatology of sea surface
c       temperature, e.g. the Reynolds climatology.
c
c   >>> ALLOW_CLIMSSS_RELAXATION <<<
c       Allow the relaxation to a monthly climatology of sea surface
c       salinity, e.g. the Levitus climatology.
c
c   >>> USE_EXF_INTERPOLATION <<<
c       Allows specification of arbitrary Cartesian input grids.

c
c       The following CPP options:
c
c          ALLOW_ATM_WIND              (WIND)
c          ALLOW_ATM_TEMP              (TEMP)
c          ALLOW_DOWNWARD_RADIATION    (DOWN)
c          ALLOW_BULKFORMULAE          (BULK)
c          EXF_READ_EVAP               (EVAP)
c
c       permit the ocean-model forcing configurations listed in the
c       table below.  The first configuration is the default,
c       flux-forced, ocean model.  The next four are stand-alone
c       configurations that use pkg/exf, open-water bulk formulae to
c       compute the missing surface fluxes from atmospheric variables.
c       The last four configurations can be used in conjunction with
c       pkg/seaice to model ice-covered regions.  The forcing fields
c       in the rightmost column are defined in exf_fields.
