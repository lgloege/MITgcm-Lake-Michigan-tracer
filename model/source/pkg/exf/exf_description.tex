Package exf contains code for an atmospheric boundary layer
scheme that can be used to force ocean simulations. This package
has options for using time-dependent and constant in time input fields.
Forcing can be calculated from user selectable combinations of 
specified fluxes and specified atmospheric state. For the latter
case the pakcage include bulk formulae that calculate air-sea
fluxes from atmospheric state. The exf package is most commonly
used for realistic domain optimization simulations.
