This verifcation run is set up to run on two processers. The atmosphere and 
seaice run in the top directory; the ocean runs in a subdirectory rank_1.
This rank_1 directory must be created - with appropriate input files - prior
to running.

A sample script to execute the mpirun command is run_cpl. 

It is also possible to run the full coupled model on a single processor,
or to distribute the ocean to several nodes, with subdirectories rank_1 
to rank_n, although the atmosphere/seaice cannot be parallelized.
(additional documentation forthcoming)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To build the atmospheric/seaice code:

The atmospheric code is located at:
http://mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm_contrib/jscott/igsm/

Here, there is a source and include directory, and a makefile which builds
an atmospheric library LIBATM.a

To make the atmice executable, there is a script (which runs a makefile) 
in the verification exp. directory exe_atmice. This script first makes a 
ocean library LIB3DO.a from the build_atmice *.o files. The MITGCM 
options turn off pretty much everything except packages THSICE and ATM2D.

The ocean code should be built in build_ocn, and the mitgcmuv executable 
which results is used directly. There are no special options needed (except
the generic coupling option) in the ocean-only code.

Pickups (to get you started) for the GISS atmosphere are located at:
http://mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm_contrib/jscott/igsm/pickup/
(these are fairly large and thus not included in input_atmice)

Support files for the GISS atmosphere (referenced in name.dat) are
in the tar ball:
http://mitgcm.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/MITgcm_contrib/jscott/

This verification experiment was run with CLM off, i.e. using a simple bucket
model included in the GISS atmosphere. Support for using CLM with be 
forthcoming.

name.dat notes: 
---------------
These are output files, and must be not present before running:
    ocndata4atm = 'ocnd4a0001.01'
    plotfl   = 'plot0001.01'
    nwrfl    = 'nwr0001.01'
These are the atmos. pickups, which are continuously overwritten:
    file1    = 'pov10001.01.bin',
    file2    = 'pov20001.01.bin',
These support files are needed (in addition to some others):
    bgrghg_data = '../ATM2D_DATA/INIT/forcing/ghgdata.GISS.2005.dat'
    fprratio  = '../ATM2D_DATA/CLMDATA/pcp2lnd-data.001x046.txt'

There are many other options to the 2D atmosphere; further support forthcoming.
