================================================

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
  cp ../verification/exp4_flt/code/*.[Fh] ../bin/

Configure and compile the code:
  cd bin
  ../tools/genmake -makefile -enable=flt
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd ../exe
  cp ../verification/exp4_flt/input/* .
  ./mitgcmuv

There is comparison output in the directory:
 ../verification/exp4_flt/results

Comments:
The input data is real*8.
