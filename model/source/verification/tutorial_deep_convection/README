Tutorial Example: "Surface Driven (Deep) Convection"
====================================================
(formerly "exp5" ;
 also "nonhydrostatic_deep_convection" in release.1 branch)


Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods ../code [-of my_platform_optionFile]
  make depend
  make

To run:
  cd run
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ln -s ../build/mitgcmuv .
  ./mitgcmuv > output.txt

There is comparison output in the directory:
  results/output.txt

Comments:
  The input data is real*8 and generated using the MATLAB script
  input/gendata.m
