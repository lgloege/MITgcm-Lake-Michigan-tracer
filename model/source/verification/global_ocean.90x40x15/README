Example: "4x4 Global Simulation with Seasonal Forcing"
============================================
(see also similar set-up in: verification/tutorial_global_oce_latlon/)

From verification/global_ocean.90x40x15 dir:

To apply the changes to the default configuration of MITgcmUV:
Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods='../code'
 [make Clean]
  make depend
  make
  cd ..
To run the code:
  cd input
  ./prepare_run
  ../build/mitgcmuv > output.txt
  cd ..

There is comparison output in directory:
  (verification/global_ocean.90x40x1/) results

Comments:
o The input data is real*4.
o The surface fluxes are derived from monthly means of the NCEP climatology;
  - a matlab script is provided that created the surface flux data files from
    the original NCEP data: ncep2global_ocean.m in the diags_matlab directory,
    needs editing to adjust search paths.
o matlab scripts that make a simple diagnostic (barotropic stream function,
  overturning stream functions, averaged hydrography etc.) is provided in
  verification/tutorial_global_oce_latlon/diags_matlab:
  - mit_loadglobal is the toplevel script that run all other scripts
  - mit_globalmovie animates theta, salinity, and 3D-velocity field for
    a layer "iz", if "meanfields=0"

--------------------------------------------
Additional example:
  similar set-up, with the same executable, and using pkg/dwnslp:
to run this 2nd example:
  cd input.dwnslp
  ln -s ../input/* .
  ../input/prepare_run
  ../build/mitgcmuv > output.dwnslp.txt
  cd ..

============================================
Adjoint set-up example:

Configure and compile the code:
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods='../code_ad'
 [make Clean]
  make depend
  make adall
  cd ..
To run the code:
  cd input_ad
  ./prepare_run
  ../build/mitgcmuv_ad > output_adm.txt
  cd ..
