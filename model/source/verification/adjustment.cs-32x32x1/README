Simple 1 layer, Barotropic adjustment on the Sphere, using the
                cubed-sphere grid 32x32x32
Contains also a "minimal" test case (just compile eesupp/src + pkgs)
                that does not do much.
=================================================================

General Description:
* using the same executable, 2 set-up can be tested, corresponding
  to input dir. "input" and "input.nlfs".
* Default set-up (input & parameter files in dir "input"):
  Oceanic set-up with flat bottom and a large quasi-rectangular
  continent is initially at rest. An initial free-surface large-scale
  anomaly centered at the equator triggers a barotropic adjustment
  and generates External Inertial-Gravity waves (Poincare waves).
  Use linear Free-Surface and linear dynamics (no momentum advection)
* Additional set-up (input & parameter files in dir "input.nlfs"):
  Atmospheric set-up, without orography, initially at rest.
  An initial large-scale surface pressure anomaly generated pure
  external gravity waves.
  Use non-linear Free-Surface, linear dynamics (no momentum advection)
  without rotation.

IMPORTANT: For the purpose of testing multiple tiles and "blank-tiles":
* Use multiple tiles (8) per cube-face (tile size: 16x8),
  which results in a total of 48 tiles:
    code/SIZE.h
    code/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
                               ( = 6-tiles default version )
    code/w2_e2setup.F        : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
  the last 2 files ave been generated with matlab script:
        MITgcm/utils/exch2/matlab-topology-generator/driver.m
* The oceanic-set-up contains 4 empty tiles (tiles: 11,12,13,14)
  associated with the large continent.
  This gives the opportunity to test the "blank-tiles" option of
  the EXCH2 pkg. An MPI version of this set-up is available to
  test this "blank-tiles" option:
    code/SIZE.h_mpi          : to replace code/SIZE.h
    code/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h : to replace pkg/exch2/W2_EXCH2_TOPOLOGY.h
    code/w2_e2setup.F_mpi    : to replace code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h_mpi
      generated with matlab script:
        MITgcm/utils/exch2/matlab-topology-generator/driver.m
      using the blank-list file: code/blanklist.txt
    code/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h_mpi : to replace eesupp/inc/CPP_EEOPTIONS.h
  However, this particular (MPI) executable cannot be used for the
  atmospheric set-up (input.nlfs) and, in this case, an error
  from S/R EXCH2_CHECK_DEPTHS will stop the execution.

Comments:

=================================================================
"minimal" test case:
 provide an example of a minimal set-up which only compiles eesupp/src
 and the 2 pkgs (exch2 & debug) which don't need model/src & inc.

code_min:
  CPP_OPTIONS.h (standard version, needed here since model/inc is not linked)
  packages.conf (2 pkgs: exch2 & debug)
  main.F        (copied from eesupp/src, but skip the call to THE_MODEL_MAIN)
  SIZE.h	(same as code/SIZE.h)
  SIZE.h_mpi    (same as code/SIZE.h_mpi)

input_min
  eedataa	(standard version)
  eedata.mth    (to test running 2 threads)
  data.exch2.mpi (to test blank-tiles with exch2 and MPI built)

to build:
 in order not to compile model/src, need to:
 either put (in build dir) a "genmake_local" file:
 % cat > genmake_local <<EOF
  STANDARDDIRS="eesupp"
EOF
 - or -
 use genmake2 command line: "genmake2 -standarddirs eesupp -mods ../code_min"
