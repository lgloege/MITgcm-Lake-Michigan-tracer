C     *==========================================================*
C     | SUBROUTINE EXCH_S3D_RX
C     | o Handle Simple exchanges (= that ignore corners)
C     |   for _RX, 3-dim scalar arrays with overlap size = 1
C     *==========================================================*
C     | Invoke appropriate exchange routine depending on type
C     | of grid (cube or globally indexed) to be operated on.
