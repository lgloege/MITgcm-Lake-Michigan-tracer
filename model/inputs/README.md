## inputs
This script `download_model_inputs.sh` is self-explanatory. If the script is not executable,
then run `chmod +x download_model_inputs.sh` to make it executable and then
`./download_model_inputs.sh` to run the script.

The script uses the `wget` command to download the files. Don't have `wget` installed? No problem.
If you are a mac users I highly recommend installing the [homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager. This following command installs homebrew:
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

```
Now installing `wget` is as simple as
```bash
brew install wget
```

The other option is to simply download the files from the links below:
