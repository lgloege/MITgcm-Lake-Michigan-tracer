Data used in this project

- `raw` = raw or unprocesed data.
- `raw/wrtds` = This directory contains daily histories of discharge (Q) in units of cubic meters per second and total phosphorus (TP) in units of mg/L for each river created using the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) method (Hirsch et al., 2010).
- `clean` = processed data. All processing scripts are in the `scripts` directory
- `shapefiles` = shapefiles used in this project

 Daily averages of surface phosphorus concentration for each river can be found [here](https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/37949)
