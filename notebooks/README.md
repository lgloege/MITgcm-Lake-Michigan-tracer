## Notebooks

This directory contains the python code used to generate figures, **~~no data is processed in these notebooks~~**. For display purposes, some figures were fine-tuned using Adobe software.
`_run_figure_notebooks.ipynb` (to state the obvious) runs all the figure notebooks. For processing scripts, see `scripts/_processing_data.ipynb`.
