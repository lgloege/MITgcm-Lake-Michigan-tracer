## Notebooks
This directory contains the python code used to generate figures, **no data is processed in these notebooks**. For display purposes, some figures were fine-tuned using Adobe software.


## Figure gallery
The `_run_figure_notebooks.ipynb` runs all the Figure notebooks and serves a figure gallery. There is weird bug in `Figure_3.ipynb` that forces you to run it twice. I haven't figured out what the issue is yet.

## How was the data processed?
All the code used to process the raw output is here ----> `scripts/_process_data.ipynb`
