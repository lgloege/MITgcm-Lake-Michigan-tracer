### Presentations
This work was presented at the Ocean Science Meeting 2018 and
and the 2018 Society for Freshwater Science annual meeting.
`presentations` contains PDF versions of these talks.

**These will soon be viewable on [slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net)**

### Movies
Early work on this project involved the simulations of an instantaneious release of a tracer.
I released the tracer at the mouth of the Milwaukee River at the start of different months and
animated its redistribution through time. The movie highlights how the spring thermal bar
acts a conduit for the tracer, keeping it confined to the coast.

**The movie is available [here](https://vimeo.com/214928932)**
